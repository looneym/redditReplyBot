A pretty straightforward Reddit bot. Because what else is there to do at 6 in the morning? 

Made to improve my skills with Python as well as trying out git and virtualenv as I want to make this nice and easy to move to my RaspberryPi or a droplet on DigitalOcean at some point, maybe. 

Initial code based off a YouTube tutorial by Wesinema, additional features to follow. 

UPDATE: bot decomissioned due to unfavourable feedback.
